        ( in short you should have serial and start with fresh factory.img )



    ################################################## builds



    WHAT-IS-IT?: these are disk images of openwrt for the rpi-4... see thread
                 or ../README for installation tips... they are based on
                 snapshot and include;

                 -common drivers ( usb nic / lte / etc. )
                 -luci + luci-theme-argon
                 -applications
                 -some installation/setup tweaks and customisations


        20201123

            -trial of two build variants...
                 * 'extra/full' and
                 * 'std/basic' for now...
             
             recommended to use the 'extra/full' as these will likely throw out
             the packagesrestore logic and there are no markers within the image
             re: variant... ( note: if you did a fresh install with the std/basic
             variant and always use this variant then above would not apply )


        "sys" = sysupgrade
        "fac" = factory


    
        any folder labelled beta,testing,unstable etc... can be ignored unless you are feeling
        lucky...

        upgrading on each (stable) release is not really beneficial unless you are feeling lucky,
        need a feature, are a power user or would like to help with testing / ironing out bugs...



        history seems to indicate that every 5-10 builds or so there are enough changes either to
        community package-set/features or official code to justify upgrading...
        or ~r14xxx(yourversion)+100-250

        'elfdat' = raspiOS-64 current stable bootfiles which are required to support usb
        boot. they should work ok with older firmware but until confirmed... they will remain
        labelled as such...
        NOTE: @20201129+ no confirmed issues so all builds contain updated elf-dat files
